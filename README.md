# WALLET AUTHENTICATION
The login system used in Web3 dApps is very different from the ones used in conventional Web2 applications.

## Authentication mechanism in Web2 Applications
In Web2 applications, companies provide services to the consumers in exchange for their personal data. Hence, traditional LogIn/SignUp mechanism works by providing a password against a username, which is verified by the server and a session cookie is issued to a user indicating successful authentication. However, this comes with a drawback of our data being stored in some server out there in th world which is potentially vulnerable to any form of mutation.  

## Authentication mechanism in Web3 Applications
In Web3 applications, authentication is done majorly done via Crypto Wallets. This is because wallets hold the keys on your deviceâ€™s browser, rather than storing them on some remote server. <br />
The wallet is first connected using a simple web3 function. Then, the user is prompted to sign a message or a nonce generated by the server using the wallet's private key. This signature is used to verify the authenticity of the user. A session token is granted by the server indicating successful authentication.
